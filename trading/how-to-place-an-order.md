# How to place an order

To create an order, go to the main top menu — click "Trade" –> "[Spot trading](https://exchange.pointpay.io/trade)". You can choose the cryptocurrency using trading pair selector. in the "Market" window by double clicking on the required coin.

On this page you can see the forms for the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please pay attention that the Order to buy or sell can not exceed your balance.
{% endhint %}

Also on the page there are windows showing actual Orders for the purchase and sale of other users of our exchange. Note that the rate is not fixed, since the PointPay platform is an exchange, not an exchanger, so the rates are taken based on the orders placed by other users on the "Trade" page.

After placing an order, you can view it on the trading page as well as in the "[History](https://exchange.pointpay.io/vault/history/transaction)" –> "[Orders](https://exchange.pointpay.io/vault/history/orders)" tab.

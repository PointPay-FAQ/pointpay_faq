<summary>What is a market order?</summary>

A market order is a request for instant purchase/sale of cryptocurrency at the best affordable market price. A market order is executed on the basis of limit orders that were previously placed in the order book. Market orders are executed instantly at the current market price.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is a stop-limit order?</summary>

A stop-limit order is an order which consists of two components: a stop price and a limit price. The stop price is the price at which the order will be added to the order book to buy or sell. The limit price is the price at which the order will be executed. Stop price and limit price may coincide. However, it would be safer to set a stop price a little higher for sell orders and lower for buy orders. A stop-limit order is usually used to fix profits (the so-called ‘take profit') or to avoid losses (the so-called ‘stop-loss’). When placing a stop-limit order on the PointPay Crypto Exchange, funds are instantly debited from the ‘Available Balance’ and reserved by the “On Orders” account.

<details>

<summary>What is a limit order?</summary>

A limit order is a request you place in an order book with a certain (limit) price. The limit price is determined by you. After placing a limit order, a transaction can be executed only if the market price reaches the established limit price. Therefore, you can use limit orders to buy/sell cryptocurrency with a price higher or lower than the current market price.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How to place buy/sell orders?</summary>

Choose the order type when placing it (Market order / Limit order / stop-limit order), then enter the amount of cryptocurrency to buy or sell and confirm your action by clicking the button "Buy" or "Sell".

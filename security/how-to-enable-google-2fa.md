# How to enable Google 2FA

**How to enable Google 2FA**

Log into your account. In the Profile menu click on the «Security»&#x20;

Choose Two-Factor Authentication section

You’ll see a 2FA enabling page with codes in two forms: usual and QR-code.

**Attention**: please, save this code in a safe place. This will allow you to recover your Google Authenticator if you lose access to your phone or app.

Open the 2FA app on your mobile device.

You can use a scanner or enter code manually to add temporary code for PointPay in your app.

Press on «+» in the bottom right corner:

Then tap on «Scan QR-code» or «Enter key manually». After it is done, a new 6-digits code appears in your app.

Put it in the 2FA enabling page:

You’ll get a notification that 2FA is enabled now.

Done, your account is secured now.

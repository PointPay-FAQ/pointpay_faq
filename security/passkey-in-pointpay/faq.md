</details>

<details>

<summary>I reset my device — what now?</summary>

The old Passkey will no longer work. Log in using email + password + 2FA, then create a new Passkey.

</details>

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens if I disable 2FA but keep Passkey?</summary>

Passkey will still protect your login with biometrics. However, classic login (email + password) will be less secure — we recommend re-enabling 2FA.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I use a password manager — will it interfere?</summary>

No, Passkey does not interfere with password managers. You can use either method seamlessly.

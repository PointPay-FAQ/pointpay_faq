<summary>What is two-factor authentication?</summary>

A two-factor authentication function is an additional resource that allows you to receive additional protection of access to your account, even if someone knows your password. When you log in to your account, you will be offered to enter two pieces of information: your password and a 6-digit authentication code. A new authentication code is generated every 30 seconds by an authentication application. We strongly recommend all our users to enable this security feature to prevent any potential unauthorized access to your accounts. This function is necessary to ensure the security of your assets, so please take the time to set it up as soon as possible!

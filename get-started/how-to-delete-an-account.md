# How to delete an account?

If you want to delete your account, you must be logged in first.

Then click to «Profile» icon (in the upper right corner), and choose «Security»:

Scroll down, and you’ll see the **«Closing account»** button.

In the next window press «Confirm» if you still want to delete your account. Here you can also cancel the process.

On the next step you need to confirm the procedure by entering code from email.

Attention: if you have activated Google 2FA, then it will be necessary to enter both codes.

If the code was entered correctly, you will be logged out and your account will be deleted.

At this step, it is still possible to cancel the deletion.

The fact that the deletion was successful is indicated by a pop-up notification in the upper right corner of the screen.

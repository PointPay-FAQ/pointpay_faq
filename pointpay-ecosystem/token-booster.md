# Token Booster

<details>

<summary>What is the Initial Listing?</summary>

The Initial Listing is a new feature within the PointPay ecosystem that rewards PXP holders with tokens newly listed on the exchange and/or in PXP tokens.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is TokenBooster?</summary>

TokenBooster is another new feature within the PointPay ecosystem, offering PXP holders additional rewards in project tokens already traded on the exchange and/or in PXP.

</details>

<details>

<summary>In what tokens are rewards paid?</summary>

Rewards are determined for each event separately. Payments may be made in the project’s tokens, in PXP, or a combination of both.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I participate in TokenBooster or Initial Listing events?</summary>

Participation eligibility is based on two factors: holding a minimum of 10,000 PXP tokens and the duration of their presence in the account balance (determined by a "snapshot").

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is a “snapshot”?</summary>

A snapshot captures user token balances as of 00:00:00 UTC each day.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much of my PXP can I use for participation in events?</summary>

Each event has a specified period during which PXP must be on your **Spot** account. The available amount is determined by the minimum balance recorded in all snapshots during that period.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can you provide an example of how this works?</summary>

For instance, if you plan to participate in an event with a 10-day snapshot collection period and initially had 10,000 PXP in your **Spot** account, later transferring 5,000 PXP to your **Earn** account and then returning it to **Spot** after 2 days, one of the snapshots will show a balance of 5,000 PXP, making exactly that amount available for the event.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are there restrictions on the number of tokens for participation?</summary>

Yes, the maximum number of tokens each participant can use is individually limited for each event.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I know if I'm eligible to participate?</summary>

Each event features a **"Commit PXP"** button, along with the available participation quantity. If this value is greater than 0, your account meets the criteria for participation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why don't I have PXP available for participation despite having tokens in my balance?</summary>

This suggests that at the time of one of the snapshots, there were no tokens in your balance. If you believe the tokens were present throughout, please contact customer support.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do all PXP tokens in my accounts count?</summary>

No, only PXP tokens that are on the **Spot** account (not in the **Staking** or **Earn** accounts) included in snapshots.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens to my PXP used for participation in events?</summary>

Your PXP remains in your balance without any restrictions; you can use them as you wish.

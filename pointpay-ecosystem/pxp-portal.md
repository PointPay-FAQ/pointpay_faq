# PXP Portal

<details>

<summary>What is the PXP Portal?</summary>

The PXP Portal is a new feature within the PointPay ecosystem that allows users to complete various tasks and earn rewards in the form of points.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are the points I receive for completing tasks?</summary>

Points are a measure of your activity within the system and contribute to your user level.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do PXP Portal Points compare to PXP Tokens?</summary>

Each point is equivalent to 1 PXP. For example, if you have 1,000 PXP and earn 500 points, your total will be 1,500 PXP, which could upgrade your level from Zinc to Bronze.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is participation in PXP Portal tasks mandatory?</summary>

No, participation is entirely optional. However, completing tasks can earn you points that help you level up and save on trading and withdrawal fees.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What types of tasks will I need to complete?</summary>

Tasks fall into three categories:

* One-time tasks (e.g., completing account verification)
* Periodic tasks (updated daily, weekly, etc.)
* Special tasks (from the administration or project partners)

</details>

<details>

<summary>If I've already completed KYC, will I still receive a reward?</summary>

Yes, users who completed KYC before the PXP Portal launch will automatically receive their reward.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will my points expire if I don't log into my account for a long time?</summary>

No, points do not expire and will remain on your PXP Portal balance.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will my points expire if I don't complete tasks for several weeks?</summary>

No, once earned, your points remain yours permanently.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How else can I earn points?</summary>

Points are also awarded for tasks completed by your 1st- and 2nd-level referrals. The more active 1st- and 2nd-level referrals you have, the more points you can earn.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I invite friends to the PXP Portal to become my referrals?</summary>

Use your standard referral link, which can be found in the “Referral Program” section of your profile: [Referral Program](https://exchange.pointpay.io/user/referrals)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is the PXP Portal available to everyone?</summary>

Yes, but your account must be verified. If you've already completed verification, you can start completing tasks immediately and will receive a reward for your verification.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I completed a task but didn't receive points. What might be the issue?</summary>

Points are awarded only if tasks are completed within the specified time frame. Actions taken outside of this period won't be credited.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I completed a task on time but didn't receive points. What should I do?</summary>

Contact user support for assistance: support@pointpay.io

</details>

<details>

<summary>How quickly are points awarded after completing tasks?</summary>

Points are usually awarded instantly after task completion verification. However, for tasks like "Make a deposit," points are awarded only after the deposit is confirmed, which may take some time.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I earned enough points for the next level, but my level didn't change. Why?</summary>

Ensure that you haven't withdrawn PXP, which could affect your total points. If everything seems correct, contact user support: support@pointpay.io

</details>

<details>

<summary>How many points will I earn from my referrals completing tasks?</summary>

A user personally invited by you is considered a 1st-level referral. 2nd-level referrals are users who were personally invited by your 1st-level referrals.

You earn 16% of the points earned by your 1st-level referrals and 8% of the points earned by your 2nd-level referrals.

# Learn & Earn

<details>

<summary>What is Learn &#x26; Earn?</summary>

Learn & Earn is a new educational product within the PointPay ecosystem designed to provide anyone interested in the rapidly growing world of cryptocurrencies with the opportunity to deepen their knowledge and earn a starting capital in USDT or other tokens. Alternatively, it can serve as a means to reinforce existing knowledge.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I participate?</summary>

Go to the Learn & Earn section ([https://exchange.pointpay.io/learn](https://exchange.pointpay.io/learn)), select a course from the list. Study the course materials and answer the test questions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I go straight to the test?</summary>

If you are confident in your knowledge of cryptocurrencies, you can test yourself. However, we still recommend that you review the course materials. It is impossible to know absolutely everything, and as they say, repetition is the mother of learning.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How many courses can I take?</summary>

All courses available in the Learn & Earn section are open for passing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How many correct answers are required to successfully complete the test?</summary>

The minimum number of correct answers required to successfully complete the course may vary and depends on the individual course conditions. Usually the minimum passing score is 60-75%

</details>

<details>

<summary>When will I receive a reward for successfully completing the course?</summary>

You become eligible to receive a reward immediately after successfully completing the test. However the claim option will become available within a few days after the course ends. Then you can get the amount to your balance in your profile. Each course has its own end timer.

<details>

<summary>I answered the test questions, but the reward is not available</summary>

Most likely, the payment has not started yet. Technical reasons cannot be ruled out.

If you encounter such a situation, please contact customer support: support@pointpay.io

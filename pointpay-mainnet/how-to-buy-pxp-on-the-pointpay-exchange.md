# How to buy PXP on the PointPay exchange?

1. Log into your account.
2. Quick way – use Quick exchange: [https://exchange.pointpay.io/quick-exchange](https://exchange.pointpay.io/quick-exchange)
3. Just choose PXP as currency you want to buy, USDT as payment currency, enter the amount and click on the “Exchange” button. Done!
4. A second way – use Spot trading interface:
5. In the top menu go to the «Trade» —>  «[Spot trading](https://exchange.pointpay.io/trade)»
6.  Then pick the PXP/USDT trading pair, choose the type of order (Market/Limit), set the amount you want to buy and click “Buy PXP”. Market order will be completed immediately, completing the Limit order may take some time.

    But in general it’s done – you’ve just bought some PXP.

# FAQ

<details>

<summary>What is the PointPay mainnet?</summary>

It is an Ethereum-like network, a fork of Ethereum, that supports similar features and has an analogous structure.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are the advantages of the PointPay mainnet?</summary>

Currently, the main advantages are low transaction fees and high transaction processing speed. The network is EVM-compatible, offering the potential to expand its stable infrastructure.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will there be an explorer?</summary>

An explorer has already been launched, and you can use it here: [https://explorer.pointpay.io/](https://explorer.pointpay.io/)

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I add the PointPay mainnet to my MetaMask?</summary>

Method 1: For advanced users

Open the MetaMask extension, select the menu option «Add custom network», and enter the following parameters:

* Network Name: PointPay Mainnet
* RPC endpoint: https://rpc-mainnet.pointpay.io
* Chain ID: 5511
* Currency Symbol: PXP
* Mainnet Block Explorer URL: https://explorer.pointpay.io/

Method 2: The simpler and faster way

At the bottom of the page [https://explorer.pointpay.io/](https://explorer.pointpay.io/), click the «Add to MetaMask» button (Note: You must be logged in).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Where can I find the network parameters?</summary>

Detailed technical information is available in the Knowledge Base: [https://pointpay.gitbook.io/base/network](https://pointpay.gitbook.io/base/network)

</details>

<details>

<summary>What will happen to the PXP token?</summary>

In the PointPay mainnet, it is the native token (like ETH in Ethereum). Support for the token in other networks will continue.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I transfer my PXP tokens from another network to the PointPay mainnet?</summary>

Currently, your account on the PointPay exchange can be used as a gateway. After depositing tokens, you need to withdraw funds by selecting the «PointPay mainnet» option. This way, the tokens will be sent to your specified address in the native network.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the role of PXP in the PointPay mainnet?</summary>

The native PXP token is used for transactions, paying gas fees, and interacting with smart contracts.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What other tokens are available in the PointPay mainnet?</summary>

The network has only recently started functioning, so the import of tokens from other projects and ecosystems is at an early stage. However, new tokens can be added to the network using smart contracts, just like in any other such type of blockchain (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.).

There is also a special tool that allows you to create your own token: [https://app.memecity.com/](https://app.memecity.com/)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I send USDT via the PointPay mainnet?</summary>

Currently, you can send so-called «wrapped» USDT tokens. In the PointPay mainnet, they are represented as pUSDT.

Smart-contract address for pUSDT: TBA

</details>

<details>

<summary>Where can I send USDT via the PointPay mainnet?</summary>

You can send «wrapped» USDT tokens (pUSDT) without fees through the PointPay mainnet to a MetaMask wallet or any other non-custodial wallet. You can also use these pUSDT on the decentralized platform DeFi Pool: [https://defipool.finance/](https://defipool.finance/)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why do we need our own network?</summary>

This is one of the stages in developing our own ecosystem. Mutual integration of the network and the ecosystem will occur.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does mining work?</summary>

Mining is not performed since the tokens have already been pre-generated (100% premine). The project has existed for several years, and most PXP tokens are already in circulation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if I want to launch my own token on your blockchain?</summary>

The system is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to create and deploy smart contracts written in Solidity and other supported programming languages. This ensures flexibility and scalability, enabling easy migration of existing Ethereum projects or the development of new ones.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is MemeCity?</summary>

[https://app.memecity.com/](https://app.memecity.com/) is a platform for exploring and decentralized trading of tokens from various ecosystems, as well as for creating and launching your own tokens.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I create a token for my project here?</summary>

The platform's main idea is to enable the creation of meme tokens, as reflected in its name. You can create any token with any name and logo. However, since a pre-built and relatively simple smart contract is used, the token's features and management capabilities will be limited.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I create my meme token on the PointPay mainnet right now?</summary>

Yes! PointPay mainnet is already integrated into the platform [https://app.memecity.com/](https://app.memecity.com/) and is available as a base network option when creating your token.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is DeFi Pool?</summary>

[https://defipool.finance/](https://defipool.finance/) is a service for token exchange built on the principles of a decentralized financial ecosystem.

</details>

<details>

<summary>There are other similar services. What makes this one different?</summary>

The main difference is that the PointPay mainnet is already integrated here, allowing you to perform decentralized operations with your tokens.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I connect to the DeFi Pool?</summary>

You can connect to the service using MetaMask or another supported wallet.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I create a token on the PointPay mainnet?</summary>

Here is a short manual:

1. Go to the platform: [https://app.memecity.com/](https://app.memecity.com/)&#x20;
2. Log in by creating a new wallet directly on the platform or importing your existing wallet. You can also do this later.
3. Open the Pump City section: [https://app.memecity.com/pump-city](https://app.memecity.com/pump-city)&#x20;
4. Click the green “Launch a new meme” button.
5. If you haven’t logged in earlier, the system will prompt you to connect an existing non-custodial wallet or create a new one (this can also be done directly on the platform).
6. A short form will open, where you need to select the network (e.g., PointPay) and fill in the token details.
7. The cost of creating a token is 10 PXP. Be sure to top up your wallet with a small extra amount to cover transfer fees.

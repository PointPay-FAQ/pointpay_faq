<summary>What is KYC, is it required?</summary>

Know your client (abbreviated KYC) is the term of banking and exchange regulation for financial institutions and bookmakers, as well as other companies working with private money, meaning that they must identify and establish the identity of the counterparty before conducting a financial transaction.

This requirement extends to obtaining reasonably complete information about counterparties-legal entities, the nature of their business and certain business transactions for which a financial transaction is being conducted.

Registration on the PointPay Platform does not require KYC verification. However, if you wish to use all the features of the platform, please refer to the account settings to determine which KYC levels you must pass.

Each tier of identification provides a different level of access to financial instruments on the PointPay platform. You may be restricted from certain activities on the PointPay platform until you have completed full identification. For instance, users without KYC are not able to make withdrawals and use Crypto Payment System to sell crypto.

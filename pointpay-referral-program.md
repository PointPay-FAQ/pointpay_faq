# PointPay Referral program

The referral program allows you to receive income from invited exchange users. The control menu is here: [https://pointpay.io/user/referrals](https://pointpay.io/user/referrals)&#x20;

**Example:** User A invites user B through a referral link. User A receives a referral commission from trading commissions every time user B trades on the PointPay exchange.

For each new user who successfully registers with PointPay via a referral link, the referrer receives a commission from the referral's trading fees on the PointPay exchange. You can now invite users through your referral link to earn money from their trades.

In order to invite a user, provide him with your referral link.

After following the link and registering, the user will become your referral.

If a new user does not register an account using your PointPay referral ID, you will not receive referral commissions for that user's trading activity on our exchange.

* Level 1 – 25% of trading commissions;

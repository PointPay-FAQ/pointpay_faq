# Earn accounts

An Earn account allows you to securely store your cryptocurrency and earn extra interest up to 1.5% yearly.

Not planning to trade in the nearest future or want to wait out strong fluctuations in the market? Simply transfer your assets to PointPay Earn accounts.

How to do it?

1\. Sign in to your account: [https://exchange.pointpay.io/login](https://exchange.pointpay.io/login)&#x20;

Go to the Earn Account menu:

2\. Click on the Transfer button or find the currency you want to transfer to your Earn account by scrolling the list (or use a filter).

3\. Both methods will open the transfer menu.

Specify currency and quantity, after that click on the Transfer button.

Transaction will be processed immediately.&#x20;

Done! Now your funds are on the Earn account.&#x20;

&#x20;

Some tips about how it works:

* you can top up your Earn account balance an unlimited number of times;
* interest is accrued daily on the amount actually in the account, but payment occurs once a month;
* funds that are in the Earn account cannot be used for trading, paying fees, or withdrawn to an external address directly from this account – for these actions you must first transfer them to the Spot account;
* you can transfer cryptocurrency to your Spot account at any time without losing your accumulated interest;
* Interest is credited automatically (no need to claim anything manually) to the same Earn account.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Attention**: if more than 3 transfers are made from your Earn account to Spot within a 30-day period, you will lose the right to receive interest until the end of the period. Accrual will resume at the beginning of the next period.
{% endhint %}

4\. To transfer funds back from your Earn account to your Spot account, simply use the switch in the menu.

5\. All the necessary information about the status of your accounts is located in the Earn accounts menu.

* APR – current interest rate
* The «Balance» column displays the number of tokens in each account.

When you hover your mouse over the «_i_» icon, information about the minimum deposit will pop up.

* The «Withdrawal» column shows the limit of transfers from the Earn account, upon reaching which the accrual of interest will stop. It is updated every 30 days.

If you hover your mouse over the counter, you will see the date range of the current period in the pop-up window.
